##### Attribution & Acknowledgment
This project is based on an amazing implementation by @codesistency
. I used their work as a learning reference to better understand real-time data transfer using Socket.io in a MERN stack application.

While the original code and structure were not written from scratch by me, I’ve gone through the entire project in detail and am confident in my ability to build and scale similar full-stack applications independently.

This repository reflects my learning journey and growth as a developer — huge thanks to the original author for making their work public and educational. 🙏
